Description:

	In figures.py I have generated five plots using the matplotlib
	module and a given data(e.g, throughput, response time). Fina-
	lly I had created a frame with data of 'No. of users' and 're
	sponse time'. Then I had used to_latex() function on that da-
	taframe to convert it to a table in latex code. Then I had 
	written the latex code into file named 'table.tex' using Python
	commands. It has also generated 5 plot figures in pdf format.

		In report.tex the default font-size is set to 11pt. I have 
	used 2 packages, i.e, graphicx and booktabs. graphicx for proper 
	placing of the images and booktabs is used for proper show of 
	tables. I have used \title to make a title of the article and
	\author to make the authorname, \date{\today} will give the day
	on which the report.tex file was last modified. I have used se-
	veral sections and subsections to make the structure of my ar-
	ticle. Each section has been labeled. To make points I have used
	enumerate and itemized. Figures are all captioned and also labe-
	led. I have also added a paragraph inside a section. I have used
	different styles in the text like bold, italics etc. I have also
	varied the size of the text like from normal to large and from
	large to huge. Mathematical equations are added with $$ equation
	$$ format. The table.tex was created by figures.py file and it is 
	added in the report.tex file using \input{table} command. Plots
	are also generated by figures.py file. These plots are added in 
	report.tex as \includegraphics{plot1.pdf}.
